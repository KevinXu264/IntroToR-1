## R Markdown and Code Chunks

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, 
and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well 
as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r NameOfChunk, include = TRUE}

# This is a code chunk. 

```

```{r ExampleChunk, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}

# Include = FALSE means the code for this will not show up in the final report, 
# change this to TRUE and see what happens.

# Warning = FALSE means that any warnings that come up while the code is running 
# will not be displayed. 

# Within code chunks, the R code will be interpreted. Outside the code chunks it will not.

# Outside the code chunks you can type in text and heading using Markdown to format and 
# organize reports.

# Create new headings outside the code chunch with one or more # symbols. For example, 
# copy and paste this code outside the code chunk and see what it does:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4, etc...

# In the R markdown CheatSheet you will find a number of useful formatting commands for your text. 

```

In this lesson we will learn to install and load the packages necessary to do data analysis in R.

```{r setup, include = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# This code chunk will load all the packages needed for this document. 

# For reports like this, it is best to install the necessary packages and load the libraries 
# first. That way you know ahead of time if you are going to run into any issues with operations later on.

library('tidyr')
library('dplyr')
library('tibble')
library('RColorBrewer')
library('ggplot2')
library('lubridate')

```

## Importing Data and Selecting Columns

We will learn to import data into R and reshape it into formats that are useful for data 
visualization. For our research question, we will work with public COVD19 data to visualize 
the number of COVID19 cases per million for every state in the form of a heatmap and imagine 
other ways we would want to visualize this kind of information. 

```{r DataImport, include = TRUE}

# This is just repeating the commands that we did in the first day(s) to import our data.

#Import the Covid Data Set
CovidData <- read.csv("us_states_covid19_daily.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

#Import the States data set (including DC and PR)
StatePop <- read.table("States.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
StatePop <- select(StatePop, State, StateAbbreviation, Pop.millions)

#Import MMR Vaccine Rate Data set from Tidy Tuesday
MMRVaccineRate <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-25/measles.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ",")

```

## Data Wrangling and Cleaning

We will learn to handle imperfect data sets, calculate new columns, clean and rename data for downstream uses.

```{r wrangling1, include = TRUE}
# Merging the tables
CovidStateData <- left_join(StatePop, CovidData, by = c("StateAbbreviation"="state"))

# Calculating new columns and filtering data
CasesPerMillion <- CovidStateData %>%
  mutate(CPM = positive/Pop.millions) %>% 
  filter(Pop.millions != "NA")

# Selecting and renaming columns
InfectionGrowth <- CasesPerMillion %>%
  select(date, State = StateAbbreviation, CPM, positive, Pop.millions) 

```

## Visualizing data trends using ggplot

In this lesson, we use ggplot to create trendlines for data that we work with.


```{r CPMGrowth, include = TRUE}

# Here we filter states that have populations over 10 million people
InfectionGrowth <- InfectionGrowth %>%
  filter(Pop.millions >= 10) 

# Here we write the ggplot code. We use the ymd() funciton on our x axis
# to make it easier to work with the dates in our table. We use geom_smooth
# to create a trend line and we set some axis labels.

CpmPlot <- ggplot(InfectionGrowth, aes(ymd(date), CPM, color = State)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") + 
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Cases Per Million", 
       title = "Covid Cases in Large States")

CpmPlot

```

```{r CPMFacets, include = TRUE}

# We can easily separate plots so that we can analyze and compare
# data in different ways using facet_wrap()

CpmPlotFacets <- ggplot(InfectionGrowth, aes(ymd(date), CPM, color = State)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "auto") + 
  facet_wrap(facets = "State") + 
  labs(x = "Date", 
       y = "Cases Per Million", 
       title = "Covid Cases in Large States")

CpmPlotFacets

```


## Visualizing data distribution with ggplot2

We created a violin plots to look at data distribution.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Selecting the data
LastMonthInfections <- InfectionGrowth %>%
  filter(date >= 20200827)

# The Plot includes mean and stadnard deviation bars
CpmViolin2 <- ggplot(LastMonthInfections, aes(State, CPM, fill = State)) +
  geom_violin(scale = "area")+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")+
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, fun.args = list(mult=1))+
  labs(title="Cases Per Million (30 day average)")

CpmViolin2

```

Finally we learned to conduct some basic statistics on data that we want to compare. 

``` {r StatTesting, include = TRUE}
# First we filter tables based on the data that we want to compare. In this # case we are 
# comparing the number of cases per million in the last month between CA and FL.

CAcases <- LastMonthInfections %>%
  filter(State == "CA")

FLcases <- LastMonthInfections %>%
  filter(State =="FL")

# We can then use the t.test() function on specific columns to calculate
# our t-test comparing the two data sets.

t.test(CAcases$CPM, FLcases$CPM)

```



## Challenge

For your breakout room sessions. Take the code chunk below and create a plot that 
is different in some way compared to the plots shown above. Feel free to use any of
the data we have imported over the course of the session. Try using a different Geom 
in ggplot, filtering the data differently, or changing some of the aes parameters.

``` {r YourPlotHere, include = FALSE}


```
