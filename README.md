# Intro to R: UCLA Collaboratory

R is one of the most commonly used and powerful statistical programming languages and is used to analyze and manipulate data for virtually every professional industry. Over the last 10 years, powerful new tools within R have emerged to make data manipulation and visualization an easier and more accessible process. The material in this repository has been written and designed as a three day workshop. This course is designed for learners who have little to no experience with R programming. The goal of this workshop is to help learners get started importing, manipulating and visualizinig data relatively quickly without an in depth explanation of R's theoretical framework. 

Day 1: Introduction to R Studio, how to find help, Rstudio cheat sheets, installing packages, loading libraries, data structures and classes, importing data, examining data sets. (2-3hrs)
Day 2: Data transformation with tidyr and dplyr, data visualization with ggplot2. (2-3hrs)
Day 3: Intro to R Markdown, peer learning activities, writing and presenting reports. (2-3hrs)

Download and unzip Part1. Go into the folder and open Part1.Rproj. This should automatically open Rstudio. Open the Part1.R file using the ‘Files’ navigator on the bottom right hand corner. Look for the Tools menu and go into ‘Global Options’. Under the tab called ‘Code’ check to make sure the box is checked for ‘Soft-wrap R source files’. This will improve the readability of code in the top left window.
